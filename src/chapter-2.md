Chapter 2: Defining the Repeating Revolution
============================================

In order to transform business through regular assessment, it is important to define the repeating revolution by identifying the components of a repeatable process, applying continuous improvement principles to business, and creating a plan for the repeating revolution. In this chapter, we will explore these steps in more detail.

Identifying the Components of a Repeatable Process
--------------------------------------------------

The first step in defining the repeating revolution is to identify the components of a repeatable process. A repeatable process is a set of procedures or steps that can be executed consistently to achieve a desired outcome.

By identifying the components of a repeatable process, organizations can ensure that their assessment program is consistent, reliable, and aligned with their business objectives.

Applying Continuous Improvement Principles to Business
------------------------------------------------------

Once the components of a repeatable process have been identified, the next step is to apply continuous improvement principles to business. This involves regularly assessing performance, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes based on those assessments.

Continuous improvement helps organizations to stay agile and adaptable in the face of changing market conditions and customer needs.

Creating a Plan for the Repeating Revolution
--------------------------------------------

Finally, it is important to create a plan for the repeating revolution that outlines the goals, processes, and tools for the initiative. This includes defining goals and objectives, establishing processes and tools for collecting and analyzing data, ensuring data quality and accuracy, and communicating results and implementing changes based on those results.

By creating a plan for the repeating revolution, organizations can ensure that the assessment process is consistent, reliable, and aligned with their business objectives. They can also drive continuous improvement and growth by regularly assessing performance and implementing changes based on those assessments.

By identifying the components of a repeatable process, applying continuous improvement principles to business, and creating a plan for the repeating revolution, organizations can successfully define and undertake the repeating revolution to transform their business.
